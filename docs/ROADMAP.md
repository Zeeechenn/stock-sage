## 当前接手入口

| 工作线 | 当前状态 | 第一动作 | 停止条件 |
|---|---|---|---|
| M45 研究定位落地 | 当前主线：amplifier-primary, source-gated；tracked docs below are self-contained, while local ADR 0001 stays git-ignored under `docs/adr/` for private follow-up | M45.1: 用 `backend.tools.m45_import_ateacher_theses` 先 dry-run A老师进口判断，再显式 `--execute` 落成 ForwardThesis + L0 pending atom | 不复活 quant、不改 production profile、不让未过门 alpha 影响真实决策 |
| M44 Atlas 合并 | complete locally: dormant `--no-ff` merge landed on local `main` at `9820143`, `ATLAS_ENABLED=false`, not pushed | 保持 dormant；push / publish only after explicit user authorization | 任何 official signal / test2 / scheduler / shared-infra drift 先停下归因或 revert merge |
| M29 Forward Evidence | routine read-only check；所有 alpha 证据仍 non-promoting，fresh forward coverage 尚未 ready | 只读跑 `backend.tools.m29_forward_readiness --db-url ...`；ready 后才追加 1d/3d/5d shadow + ledger | 会恢复 quant、改 production profile、接 checkpoint、写真实 `sentiment_cache` 或调额外付费服务时先确认 |
| 后置/低优先 | M24.3 / M25 / M21.4 / M12 / M10.5 / M4 / M5 | 只在触发条件满足时启动 | 不从历史摘要推出新的生产行为 |

## M45 研究定位落地：放大器为主、源受门控【P1】

Decision summary:

- test4 Stage 1 / 2a in `docs/ATLAS_TEST4_EXPERIMENT.md` found no historical edge in the backtestable signal component: technical IC flat/negative, regime signs reversed, quant already `WEIGHT_QUANT=0.0`, and test2 remains too small for promotion evidence.
- Offense / alpha should come from imported human judgment and the user's own filter / veto / sizing, not from manufacturing a price-pattern oracle.
- AI's role is breadth, falsification, and short-term risk discipline. AI-surfaced alpha attempts and trusted-memory promotion must pass forward, outcome-gated falsification before influencing real decisions.
- Atlas L0-L4 implements the loop: import -> record -> falsify -> review -> learn. M29 quant-alpha reset is now one unproven input, not the north star.

Boundaries:

- Keep Atlas dormant by default: `ATLAS_ENABLED=false`.
- Do not change official signals, test2, scheduler, production profile, stops, sizing, or position state.
- ADR 0001 remains local/private under `docs/adr/` and is intentionally git-ignored; tracked docs must carry enough context to stand alone.

### M45.1 进口通道结构化（first action）

- [x] Define and implement a dry-run-first import contract in `backend/tools/m45_import_ateacher_theses.py`: source, as_of, symbol/theme, statement, invalidation conditions, follow-up metrics, review cadence, decision_owner=`human`, trust=`pending`.
- [x] Store the thesis layer through existing Atlas-safe surfaces: `ForwardThesis` for statement / invalidation / evidence manifest plus L0 pending atom for memory context.
- [x] Prepared a local seed input and dry-run output under `/private/tmp/stocksage_m45_ateacher_seed_20260605*.json`; no DB writes were made.
- [x] Add execute-time source fidelity guard: `--execute` requires `source_kind=direct_source`, `source_verified=true`, `source_verified_by`, explicit `source_ref`, and source locator; dry-run surfaces `source_fidelity.execute_blockers`.
- [ ] Review the seed's source fidelity before execute: it is derived from local M45 handoff context, not a direct A-teacher transcript.
- [ ] Execute import only after reviewing dry-run output; imported rows remain draft/pending and do not become trusted automatically.
- [ ] Use `backend/research/thesis_ledger.py` only where its thinner `symbol/title/kill_conditions/status` shape is sufficient, or extend it deliberately after tests.
- [ ] Ensure imports are idempotent and do not create trusted memory automatically.
- [ ] A-teacher hook updates should become ledger entries, not markdown-only notes.

### M45.2 放大器证伪记分牌

- [ ] Invalidation-catch ledger: when a held thesis breaks, record whether the alarm fired before loss materialized or was missed.
- [ ] Defensive-value ledger: compare system-on/off drawdown and loss rate for the short-term risk lane; do not judge this lane by IC.
- [ ] Track breadth hits separately: AI-surfaced, human-adopted theses that later work are slow secondary evidence.
- [ ] Route review outcomes through Atlas L4 / ReviewCase so trusted promotion remains outcome-gated.

### M45.3 模块三连分诊

- [ ] Classify existing modules into breadth / falsification / short-term risk.
- [ ] Mark modules that fit none of those buckets as removal or quarantine candidates.
- [ ] Treat A-teacher / jingqi / Piotroski skills as first-class import channels.

### M45.4 Stage 2b forward shadow（slow evidence path）

- [ ] Pre-register test4 Stage 2b arms, metrics, failure conditions, sample window, and small-sample handling.
- [ ] Use M45.1 theses as shadow objects. test2 stays frozen.
- [ ] Promotion requires Stage 2b pass plus explicit user confirmation; test4 never changes official signals by itself.

## M44 Atlas 合并与 L0-L4 主架构升级【complete locally / dormant】

Current fact pattern:

- Local `main` includes M43 baseline merge `4882d49` and dormant Atlas merge `9820143`.
- Atlas remains off by default via `ATLAS_ENABLED=false` / `settings.atlas_enabled=False`.
- Local `main` has not been pushed.
- Full verification recorded for the readiness / merge package: `make verify`, test2 raw zero diff at `--end 2026-06-05`, DB copy-smoke, dormant-context guard, official-signal fixture, and `git diff --check`.

Still-live boundaries:

- Do not use Atlas behavior in official signals, test2/test3, 标的1, scheduler, postmarket, stop/take, sizing, or production scoring while dormant.
- Shared-infra changes are not protected merely by the dormant flag. Database migrations, runtime schema, dependency/lockfile, scheduler helpers, API helpers, and data-loading helpers still need parity checks.
- If user authorizes push or release, first rerun a lightweight publish gate: `git status`, branch divergence, `git diff --check`, focused dormant/official-signal/test2 smoke, and only then full `make verify` if release quality is needed.
- Revert target remains `9820143` if Atlas merge causes behavior drift; `pre-atlas-m43-baseline` points to `4882d49`.

Post-merge follow-up:

- [ ] Keep M31/M41/M42/M43 mainline capabilities protected.
- [ ] Phase 3-full remains 后置: full legacy adapters/backfill, A-teacher/long-term/topic reports, native ResearchCase / ActionProposal L0 wiring.
- [ ] Push local `main` only after explicit user authorization.

## M29 Alpha Reset / Forward Evidence Engine【active / non-promoting】

Production remains `new_framework`, `WEIGHT_QUANT=0.0`, Kronos disabled. No candidate has passed the promotion gate:

- IC >= 0.04
- ICIR >= 0.40
- monotonic buckets
- non-overlapping / stride evidence
- sufficient fresh forward sample
- no cache, fallback, provenance, or data-quality blockers
- human confirmation

Current execution:

1. Read `STATUS.md` and this section, then run `git status --short`.
2. First action is read-only: `backend.tools.m29_forward_readiness --db-url ...`.
3. If not ready, stop and wait. Do not treat partial local data as fresh evidence.
4. If ready, run 1d/3d/5d forward shadow bundle and add artifacts to `m29_evidence_ledger`.
5. Update M29.5 residual attribution in the same forward window. If still non-promoting, keep quant off.

Stop before any production change, checkpoint wiring, Kronos long training, true `sentiment_cache` writes, new dependency download, or extra paid external service.

## Other Open Items

| Item | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| M32 Forward Hypothesis Bridge | Review data becomes thick enough | Register sector / supply-chain theses as forward hypotheses; output falsifiable thesis, not Strong Buy labels |
| M24.3 Long-term constraint reconnect | Suggested checkpoint 2026-06-10 and later test2 freeze end >= 2026-07-18 | Shadow-only outcome analysis; enable constraints only if false positives fall without meaningful missed entries |
| M25 product/community leftovers | Low priority / actual need | README demo, verified quickstart, mobile core paths, virtual list only after watchlist >200 causes lag |
| M21.4 ATR narrow-stop analysis | After 2026-07-18 | Analyze closed test1/test2 positions before changing stop rules |
| M12 external data governance | Any new endpoint | Add provider health, PIT timestamp, field normalization, and tests before DB writes |
| M10.5 migrations | SQLite runtime patch becomes bottleneck | Consider Alembic baseline |
| M4 / M5 automation | Strong validated evidence and explicit user intent | LangGraph / FinMem / broker automation stay deferred; no real trades |
