## M46 用户可发现性与上手路径【complete】

Current fact pattern:

- 0.3.1 trust patch and onboarding fix are complete: A0 baseline, naming/version cleanup, screenshot-backed README preview, `docs/WHY_NOT_AI_STOCK_PICKER.md`, `make demo`, frontend lint summary in `verify`, `mingcang stock`, and bilingual no-key demo path.
- Next product gap from zero-background review: users need a task manual and a capability/status map, not more features or a giant README.

Decision: keep `README.md` / `README_EN.md` as thin GitHub routers; put task walkthroughs in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`; put capability boundaries and key/provider needs in `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md`; keep architecture/roadmap as depth docs.

Completed tasks:

- [x] Enrich demo data so the first frontend screen does not look like an empty production database: demo seed now adds sample prices, latest signals, CSI 300 rows, and one demo position without touching real data or production providers.
- [x] Rework public docs into docs-site shape under `docs_public/`: `index.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `FEATURE_MAP.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, and `mkdocs.yml`.
- [x] Create `docs_public/FEATURE_MAP.md` with per-feature explanations, entry points, status, side effects, signal impact, and key/provider requirements.
- [x] Review docs navigation after user feedback; add screenshots, expected-output snippets, and a 15-minute walkthrough.
- [x] Slim README after the two docs exist: README stays as a thin GitHub router and links deeper user/developer docs.

Stop conditions:

- Do not expose personal trading records, real databases, provider keys, or local-only paths in public docs.
- Do not let demo/sample data affect production DB, scheduler jobs, official signals, or memory promotion.
- Do not move internal Mxx/Atlas/test2 planning into user-facing docs except as clearly marked maintainer context.

## M46.5 正确性底线：证据不泄漏、前端不误导【complete】

Rationale: M46 improves discoverability (demo, screenshots, walkthrough). For a
project whose value proposition is "evidence you can trust, no AI guessing", a
lookahead leak or a wrong on-screen price/PnL is a foundation-level correctness
defect. These two gates run in parallel with M46 and take precedence when they
conflict.

Completed tasks:

- [x] Lookahead leakage one-time audit (audit first, do NOT build a tool):
  answer the existing-data question — have past signals / memory-promotion
  paths already been contaminated by future data? A one-off script/notebook is
  fine; product-grade CLI is M47, not now.
  - [x] Check whether news / announcement timestamps post-date the signals they
    influenced.
  - [x] Check whether qfq/hfq, restatement, earnings, or provider fallback fed
    future data into backtest / review windows.
  - [x] Check whether any LLM summary used information dated after the signal day.
  - [x] Write the audit conclusion into a tracked doc (ADR 0001 is local /
    git-ignored — do not rely on it as the only record).
- [x] Key financial-number display tests (frontend): price, percentage, position
  size, PnL, date, null/empty, qfq/hfq display. Wrong display destroys trust as
  surely as a leak; this is pulled out of M48 so it is not deferred behind the
  TypeScript migration.

Audit conclusion (2026-06-09, `backend.tools.m46_5_lookahead_one_time_audit`,
read-only immutable SQLite):

- Overall status: `warning`, no `blocked` findings.
- Pass: signal `data_timestamp` did not post-date signal day; every stored
  signal had price data on/before signal day; financial `disclosure_date` was
  not earlier than `report_date`; review cases did not reference future signals;
  no trusted memory-promotion candidate lacked a review case; PIT guards cover
  Price / Signal / LongTermLabel / FinancialMetric / IndexPrice / NewsItem.
- Warning: 501 `signals.date` rows use timestamp-like strings instead of plain
  `YYYY-MM-DD`; 223 sentiment-bearing signals have same-symbol next-day news
  requiring lineage review; 395 financial rows lack exact `disclosure_date`;
  843,391 price rows lack full `source` / `fetched_at` / `adjustment`
  provenance; 2 review cases were created before their `as_of` date and should
  stay non-promoting unless reviewed.
- No signal freeze or memory-promotion pause was triggered because there were no
  blocked findings. Warnings become M47 standing-check / visibility work, not
  automatic production changes.

Acceptance:

- Audit produces a report that clearly separates pass / warning / blocked.
- Any blocked finding freezes the related signal / pauses the matching memory
  promotion BEFORE M46 demo work continues.
- Key display components carry unit tests; a changed API number field surfaces
  at the type or test layer.

Stop conditions:

- warning does not auto-affect production signals; blocked does not auto-trigger
  memory promotion.
- Do not promote the one-time audit into a productized feature here — that is M47.

## M47 数据与证据可信度：lookahead 常驻化 + 健康可见【complete】

Trigger: M46.5 audit口径 stable. Goal: turn the one-time leakage audit into a
repeatable gate, and make data trust visible in the UI.

Completed tasks:

- [x] Integrate `mingcang evidence lookahead-check` as a standing CLI that
  re-runs the M46.5 checks on demand and on sample/demo data.
- [x] Surface data coverage / provider fallback / freshness in the frontend so a
  user can see WHY a signal is or isn't trustworthy.
- [x] Wire results into data coverage / FEATURE_MAP / review export.
- [x] Record an explicit open decision: do we ever re-activate the dormant
  "brain" (quant weight, Kronos, Atlas, non-promoted alpha)? This round: NO
  (consistent with non-promoting gates). But log it as a decision, not a default
  drift. The M29 IC/ICIR/monotonic-bucket/fresh-sample gate is the reactivation
  path if it ever happens.

Decision recorded: no dormant-brain reactivation in M47. Quant weight, Kronos,
Atlas overlays, and non-promoted alpha remain dormant / shadow-only until the
M29 promotion gate passes and the user explicitly confirms the reactivation.

Acceptance:

- lookahead-check runs on demo data and emits pass / warning / blocked.
- warning does not affect production signal; blocked does not trigger promotion.
- Reactivation decision is written down with its gate, not left implicit.

## M48 前端可靠性【complete】

WorkBuddy's frontend-weakness判断 still holds even with the TS / Zustand / UI
primitive地基 in place. Key financial-number display tests已提前到 M46.5; M48
carries the rest of frontend hardening.

Completed tasks:

- [x] Type API responses, covering signal / review / position / data coverage first.
- [x] Extend frontend tests from the current set toward critical user paths:
  `make frontend-test` now delegates to `npm test`, so `src/store/*.test.js`
  is included in the project gate.
- [x] Migrate key UI cards to TS/TSX without a big-bang page migration:
  `SignalCard` and `EvidenceCard` now compile against typed signal, evidence,
  research, and data coverage contracts.
- [x] Consolidate SignalCard / EvidenceCard status pills onto a shared
  `StatusBadge` primitive. There is no standalone `ReviewTable` component in
  the current frontend; review responses are covered by the typed API layer.

Acceptance:

- A changed API field surfaces at the type or test layer.
- No horizontal overflow / hidden critical state on mobile.

---

## M49 工具入口与可观测性【complete / P2】

Tools attic已开始 (`refactor(tools)` 归档零引用脚本)，但还需要系统治理。

Open tasks:

- [x] Build a tools classification table: stable / maintenance / evidence / attic (`backend.tools.registry`).
- [x] Give stable capabilities a unified CLI or doc entry (`python3 -m backend.agent.cli tools`).
- [x] Annotate historical Mxx scripts: still runnable? read-only? writes DB?
- [x] Pass `correlation_id` through key API / export / memory-candidate paths (structlog地基已有).
- [x] Continue converging runtime patch with Alembic migration discipline: M49 added no schema/runtime patch; future DB changes stay Alembic-first.

Acceptance:

- Every retained `backend/tools/` script has a purpose, read/write boundary, and
  recommended entry point.
- A single request / research run is traceable through logs.

Completion notes:

- `backend.tools.registry` is the M49 tool registry; `mingcang tools --pretty` exposes it to local agents/operators, with optional `--category stable|maintenance|evidence|attic`.
- API requests now bind/echo `X-Correlation-ID`; exports preserve it in response headers, postmarket HTML includes it in report metadata, and memory-candidate creation writes it into the audit trail when present.
- No signal, scheduler, production profile, or memory promotion behavior changed.

## v0.3.3 产品化收尾与当前接手状态【complete】

Current fact pattern:

- `main` is aligned with `origin/main`; HEAD is tagged `v0.3.3`.
- v0.3.3 closed the post-0.4/1.0 productization leftovers without production
  signal drift: first-run wizard, data health page, per-signal rule/provenance,
  reproducible offline evidence, community provider example, API contract, and
  stricter CI/dependency gates.
- Current production profile remains `new_framework`, `WEIGHT_QUANT=0.0`,
  technical/sentiment `0.6 / 0.4`, Kronos off, Atlas dormant.
- 2026-06-09 read-only M29 readiness is blocked:
  `ready_to_run_forward_shadow=false`; latest price date is 2026-06-08, but full
  100-symbol complete coverage is only through 2026-06-02, and recognizable
  1d/3d/5d existing forward artifacts are missing.
- M32 is not the next default: local review/thesis data is still thin
  (`review_cases=2`, `forward_theses=2` as of 2026-06-09).

Next default:

1. Keep docs and handoffs anchored on `v0.3.3`.
2. Diagnose M29 coverage/artifact gaps in read-only or preview mode.
3. Run forward shadow only after readiness emits concrete next commands.
4. Keep M24.3 shadow-only review behind its checkpoint and evidence trigger.

Stop conditions:

- Do not change production signal weights, thresholds, stops, scheduler, test2,
  memory promotion, or position state from this status-sync work.
- Do not treat readiness, productization, screenshots, or demo data as alpha
  promotion evidence.
- Do not create ad hoc planning files in the repo.

## M45 研究定位落地：放大器为主、源受门控【complete / guardrails】

Completed summary:

- The direction is settled: 明仓是 human-judgment amplifier, not a price-pattern oracle. AI handles breadth, falsification, and short-term risk discipline; any alpha-like output must remain outcome-gated before it can influence real decisions.
- `backend.tools.m45_import_ateacher_theses` is the canonical dry-run-first importer. Execute requires direct-source fidelity (`source_kind=direct_source`, verified source, explicit `source_ref`, locator) and writes only `ForwardThesis(draft)` plus L0 `pending`.
- `backend.tools.m45_falsification_scoreboard` writes ReviewCase scoreboard events and optional pending promotion candidates; `not_due` rows never create promotion candidates.
- Module ownership is triaged: dossier / deep research / long-term analyst channels are breadth; forward thesis / review loop / stress test / M45 tools are falsification; risk manager surfaces are short-term risk; weighted long-term-label voting remains legacy/quarantine unless re-gated.
- Stage 2b is pre-registered as non-promoting shadow evidence: imported-human-thesis, falsification-warning, short-term-risk, and breadth-hit arms; small samples stay qualitative.

Live contract for future work:

- Later imports still require dry-run review before `--execute`; imported rows remain draft/pending and do not become trusted memory automatically.
- Do not touch official signals, test2, scheduler jobs, production profile, stops, sizing, or position state from M45 tooling.
- Promotion requires forward evidence plus explicit user confirmation; anecdotal wins are not enough.
- ADR 0001 is local/git-ignored, so tracked docs and code comments must carry any conclusion future agents need.

## M44 Atlas 合并与 L0-L4 主架构升级【complete / dormant】

Current fact pattern:

- `origin/main` now contains dormant Atlas merge `9820143`; `ATLAS_ENABLED=false` / `settings.atlas_enabled=False`.
- Historical readiness package covered `make verify`, test2 raw zero diff at `--end 2026-06-05`, DB copy-smoke, dormant-context guard, official-signal fixture, and `git diff --check`.
- Keep M31/M41/M42/M43 behavior protected. Phase 3-full remains 后置: legacy adapters/backfill, A-teacher/long-term/topic reports, native ResearchCase / ActionProposal L0 wiring.
- Atlas/test4 Stage 2b has a signal-overlay shadow starter:
  `backend.tools.atlas_test4_stage2b_shadow`. It emits non-promoting artifacts
  under `/private/tmp` by default, leaves `ATLAS_ENABLED=false`, and does not
  mutate `paper_trading/test2_ab_state.json`. Exit-overlay and entry+exit arms
  are registered but not started.

Still-live boundaries: no Atlas behavior in official signals, test2/test3, 标的1, scheduler, postmarket, stop/take, sizing, or production scoring while dormant. Shared-infra changes still need parity checks because the dormant flag does not protect database/runtime/dependency/API helper drift.

---

## M29 Alpha Reset / Forward Evidence Engine【active / non-promoting】

Production remains `new_framework`, `WEIGHT_QUANT=0.0`, Kronos disabled. No candidate has passed the promotion gate:

- IC >= 0.04
- ICIR >= 0.40
- monotonic buckets
- non-overlapping / stride evidence
- sufficient fresh forward sample
- no cache, fallback, provenance, or data-quality blockers
- human confirmation

Current execution:

1. Read `STATUS.md` and this section, then run `git status --short`.
2. First action is read-only: `backend.tools.m29_forward_readiness --db-url ...`.
3. Current 2026-06-09 readiness artifact is not ready:
   `ready_to_run_forward_shadow=false`, full 100-symbol complete coverage only
   through 2026-06-02, missing existing 1d/3d/5d forward artifacts. Diagnose or
   repair those inputs before any shadow bundle.
4. If not ready, stop and wait. Do not treat partial local data as fresh evidence.
5. If ready, run 1d/3d/5d forward shadow bundle and add artifacts to `m29_evidence_ledger`.
6. Update M29.5 residual attribution in the same forward window. If still non-promoting, keep quant off.

Stop before any production change, checkpoint wiring, Kronos long training, true `sentiment_cache` writes, new dependency download, or extra paid external service.

## Other Open Items

| Item | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| M32 Forward Hypothesis Bridge | Review data becomes thick enough | Register sector / supply-chain theses as forward hypotheses; output falsifiable thesis, not Strong Buy labels |
| M24.3 Long-term constraint reconnect | Suggested checkpoint 2026-06-10 and later test2 freeze end >= 2026-07-18 | Shadow-only outcome analysis; enable constraints only if false positives fall without meaningful missed entries |
| M25 product/community leftovers | Low priority / actual need | README demo, verified quickstart, mobile core paths, virtual list only after watchlist >200 causes lag |
| M21.4 ATR narrow-stop analysis | After 2026-07-18 | Analyze closed test1/test2 positions before changing stop rules |
| M12 external data governance | Any new endpoint | Add provider health, PIT timestamp, field normalization, and tests before DB writes |
| M10.5 migrations | SQLite runtime patch becomes bottleneck | Consider Alembic baseline |
| M4 / M5 automation | Strong validated evidence and explicit user intent | LangGraph / FinMem / broker automation stay deferred; no real trades |
