# StockSage

Personal A-share decision-support system: local data foundation, quant/technical indicators, LLM news sentiment, multi-agent risk control and memory governance, producing auditable stock-selection and position suggestions. StockSage is advisory only. It does not predict prices, does not place orders and does not make the final investment decision for the user.

## Overview

StockSage is a personal A-share research and decision-support workstation. It stores market data, news, fundamentals, QFII holdings, index data and manual positions in local SQLite, then combines technical signals, LLM news sentiment, long-term analyst labels, risk management and portfolio constraints into auditable trading suggestions.

The current default production profile is `new_framework`: 60% technical signal, 40% LLM sentiment and 0% Qlib quant weight. The Qlib/LightGBM engineering pipeline is available, but recent expanded validation did not pass the alpha gate, so quant remains disabled in production.

## Architecture

1. Data sources: AkShare, fundamentals/QFII, market-cap and flow snapshots, news feeds, manual positions and runtime config.
2. Storage: SQLite keeps prices, news, signals, positions, reviews, chat history and memory. Point-in-time access reduces look-ahead bias.
3. Analysis: technical indicators, news source audit, LLM sentiment, offline Qlib validation, long-term analyst team and manual deep research.
4. Decision: `backend/decision/aggregator.py` merges signals; the multi-agent pipeline adds research, trading, risk and portfolio constraints.
5. Delivery: FastAPI and React expose the dashboard; Bark sends buy-signal and 14:30 stop-loss alerts.
6. Governance: ai_memory, layered decision memory, audit_log_fts, chat summaries, TTL cleanup and daily backups.

## Current Status

| M9 | Memory integration and governance | Mostly done, including memory admin, audit, summaries and backups |
| M10 | Reliability and product polish | M10.0-M10.4 done; M10.5 deferred |

## Feature Highlights

**Data and Coverage**

- A-share market data, stock news and index synchronization.
- Fundamentals, QFII holdings, market cap, float market cap and fund-flow features.
- Provider registry with fallback and health tracking.
- Data coverage snapshot for active stocks, price coverage, two-year price coverage, fundamentals coverage, 24h news coverage and signal date range.
- Point-in-time reads for training and inference to reduce look-ahead risk.

**Signals and Analysis**

- Technical factors: ATR, RSI, MA, RSRS and regime filters.
- LLM news sentiment scoring with rationale.
- News source audit by source, URL traceability, freshness and duplicate titles.
- Qlib/LightGBM pipeline with technical, PIT fundamental and market-flow features.
- Backtrader, walk-forward, holdout, DSR, PBO, IC significance, threshold sweep and exit experiments.

**Multi-Agent Decision Making**

- Long-term analyst team: sector thesis, Piotroski quality, prosperity indicators and QFII outflow veto.
- Researcher: bull/bear multi-round debate with graceful fallback.
- Research Director: quality review and debate-topic selection.
- Trader: converts evidence into trading suggestions.
- Risk Manager: risk veto, ATR take-profit/stop-loss and kill-switch constraints.
- Portfolio Manager: allocation under single-stock, sector and total exposure limits.

**Frontend Workspace**

- Pulse dashboard with watchlist, latest signals, market snapshot, real positions and activity feed.
- Stock detail page with chart, latest signal, news, evidence, reviews and long-term labels.
- Review center for daily and long-term reviews with Markdown report rendering.
- Position manager with stock search, open/closed positions and realized PnL.
- AI chat with session isolation, confirmation workflow, Markdown replies and SSE streaming.
- Admin page for weights, exposure limits, data backfill parameters, review schedules and memory management.

**Memory and Audit**

- `ai_memory` for long-term rules, risk preferences, research indexes and user preferences.
- Layered decision memory for symbol-level medium-term notes and global long-term reflections.
- `audit_log_fts` for searchable memory, research, recall, backup and action events.
- `should_remember()` heuristic before long-term memory writes.
- User confirmation before chat-triggered memory writes.
- TTL cleanup, daily backup and chat-window summarization.

**Manual Deep Research**

- CLI/API deep research flow with industry researcher, company researcher, risk reviewer, source auditor and report writer.
- Default report path: `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.
- Deep research writes an indexed memory pointer but does not create a `Signal` or participate in daily postmarket signals.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone <repo-url> && cd stock-sage
pip install ".[dev]"

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and optionally BARK_KEY

# 3. Initialize database
python3 backend/data/database.py

# 4. Start backend
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# 5. Start frontend in another terminal
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 for the dashboard. API docs are available at http://localhost:8000/docs.

## Roadmap

**Near term**

- Finish the M2 test-1 closing summary and start the two-month test-2 validation.
- Compare real paper-trading results against system suggestions, manual actions, stop rules and holding periods.
- Keep calibrating entry threshold, exit logic, trailing stop and exposure limits.

**Mid term**

- Consider a small Qlib weight such as 0.1 only after M2/M3 independent validation passes.
- Keep Qlib restoration offline-first: factor versioning, train/validation windows, IC/ICIR, monotonic buckets and cost-adjusted returns.
- Add an Alembic baseline to gradually replace `create_all + runtime patch`.
- Generate TypeScript types/client from OpenAPI for high-traffic frontend pages.
- Move scheduling out of the FastAPI process via `backend.scheduler_worker` and launchd/systemd/supervisor.

**Deferred**

- LangGraph pipeline rewrite only if test-2 provides enough samples and path B clearly beats path A.
- Full FinMem replacement only if memory depth shows verified improvement in return or drawdown.
- US market expansion stays deferred until the A-share path is stable and explicitly needed.
- QMT/miniQMT execution stays deferred until paper trading and holdout validation pass.

## Disclaimer

StockSage is a personal research and decision-support tool, not investment advice. It does not place trades automatically. LLMs do not predict prices. Take-profit and stop-loss levels are generated from ATR formulas and risk constraints. Users are responsible for all trading decisions and financial risks.
