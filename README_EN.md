# MingCang

**MingCang is a local-first personal A-share research and decision workbench.** It breaks "I like this stock" into an auditable loop — **import judgment → record evidence → falsify → track → review & attribute → update memory** — so every judgment can be replayed, challenged, and verified, and every outcome becomes evidence you can use next time.

The goal isn't a smarter "prediction AI." It's a **research operating system** for the individual investor:

- **You** own alpha, sector knowledge, and the final decision;
- **AI** handles breadth sweeps, falsification, and short-term risk discipline;
- **the system** turns judgments and outcomes into memory that grows over time.

## What it helps you do

| You want to... | How MingCang plugs in |
|---|---|
| **Research one stock** | `mingcang stock 000001` pulls signals, news, labels, and the research-copilot shadow conclusion, and records your judgment as a `ResearchCase` |
| **Track a long-term theme/sector** | Import theses from external analysts, institutions, or prosperity frameworks as a `ForwardThesis` with invalidation conditions and a review cadence, tracked over time |
| **Stay on top of daily signals & risk** | Technical factors + LLM news sentiment generate the official signal; ATR trailing stops protect gains; exposure and data-quality alerts fire automatically |
| **Review and compound experience** | After outcomes land, attribute results; falsification hits/misses are scored; only human-confirmed lessons promote into trusted memory |
| **Let AI do all of the above** | A built-in `mingcang` Pi terminal, plus Claude Code / Codex / Cursor via CLI / MCP |

MingCang never decides for you: **LLMs don't predict prices, don't place orders, and don't silently change signals.** Stops are ATR-derived rules, and memory only promotes after outcomes and human confirmation.

## Architecture: the research-to-decision loop

0.3.0 rebuilds the whole research model into a **case-based loop**: four "cases" wire research, signal, position, and review into one loop across five layers (L0–L4). Each case answers exactly one question, and they link to each other and stay auditable.

![MingCang research-to-decision architecture](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

```
Import (data + news + your judgment + external theses)
        │
        ▼
  ResearchCase ──▶ SignalCase ──▶ PositionCase ──▶ ReviewCase
   why study it?    tradable now?   why hold / when exit?  what did it teach?
        ▲                                                     │
        └──────────── memory update (outcome-gated, human-confirmed) ◀───┘
```

| Layer | Name | Question | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Memory / Knowledge Base | What have I learned before? | User rules, reviewed lessons, research memory; LLM output defaults to `pending` and cannot self-promote to trusted |
| **L1** | Evidence | What reliable evidence exists? | Source/time/PIT/quality-aware evidence cards; packaging only, no scoring |
| **L2** | Thesis | Is this worth studying? | `ResearchCase`, `ForwardThesis`, theme hypotheses; advisory, never overrides official action |
| **L3** | Signal / Position | Tradable now? How to enter/exit? | `SignalCase` / `PositionCase` proposals and shadow output; doesn't touch real positions directly |
| **L4** | Review / Promotion / Calibration | What did the outcome teach? | `ReviewCase` attribution → memory-promotion candidate; trusted promotion stays human-gated |

### How the pieces fuse together

- **Single-stock research** → the `ResearchCase → SignalCase → PositionCase` path: `mingcang stock <symbol>` gives you the official signal, news, labels, and the research copilot's shadow conclusion in one shot.
- **Long-term / theme research** → lives in **L2 (Thesis)**: external analyst, institutional, and prosperity/financial-framework judgments are imported as a `ForwardThesis` (with invalidation conditions, follow-up metrics, review cadence) and tracked as slow evidence — never a shortcut to a buy score.
- **Where data comes from** → **L1 (Evidence) + the data layer**: A-share prices/financials/QFII, news sentiment, A/HK/US read-only global data, all in local SQLite, never the cloud; a Provider Guard enforces freshness and adjustment-basis sanity.
- **What memory is for** → **L0 + L4**: rules, lessons, and research indexes are stored in layers; only ReviewCase-attributed, human-confirmed outcomes promote from `pending` to trusted, then feed back as context for the next judgment — that's why the loop grows.

> **Status**: this case-based loop has landed but is **dormant by default** — the skeleton comes first with zero production-signal change, activating layer by layer as the forward-evidence gate clears. Production signals remain technical 0.6 + sentiment 0.4 + ATR 2.5 trailing stop; quant stays off pending evidence.

## What's working now

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| Data | Market, news, fundamentals, QFII, A/HK/US read-only global data — local SQLite, stays on your machine |
| Signals | Technical factors + LLM news sentiment, weighted 0.6 / 0.4 in production, ATR 2.5 trailing stop |
| Research | Stock dossier, deep research, thesis import, falsification scoreboard, external analyst / institutional ingest |
| Memory | Layered memory, outcome-gated promotion, full audit log |
| Agent | Built-in `mingcang` Pi terminal + MCP / CLI for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor |
| UI | React frontend + REST API, local-first |

---

## Quick start

MingCang ships with a **`mingcang` Pi terminal shell** — it packages the whole CLI, memory, research flow, and safety boundaries into a ready-to-use agent terminal, so you don't have to memorize commands.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zeeechenn/MingCang/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
mingcang
```

Once installed, just talk to it in plain language ("look at 300308", "scan my watchlist", "review last week's positions") — it reads project context, runs the CLI, and returns research and risk conclusions itself.

Manual / dev mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeeechenn/MingCang.git
cd MingCang
make agent-setup   # prepare environment
make agent         # launch the Pi terminal
```

Default `AI_PROVIDER=local_cli` routes internal LLM work through your local Claude CLI — no cloud key needed. You can also call the raw CLI:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli health --pretty
python3 -m backend.agent.cli premarket --pretty
python3 -m backend.agent.cli stock-context 000001 --pretty
```

> Migration: the legacy `stocksage` command, `stock_sage_*` MCP tools, and `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_*` env vars remain available during transition. New installs should use `mingcang`.

---

## Usage guide

Once installed, you can either talk to the `mingcang` Pi terminal in plain language or run the raw CLI. Here are the most common flows.

### Research one stock

Tell the Pi terminal "research Zhongji Innolight" or "how does 300308 look right now?" — it pulls the stock context first, then concludes:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli stock-context 300308 --pretty
```

You get the official signal (buy / watch / avoid), recent news and sentiment, long-term labels, the research copilot's shadow conclusion, and the risks and open questions it lists. For deeper digging, have it run a deep-research pass:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli action research.deep.run \
  --payload-json '{"topic":"1.6T optical module demand","symbols":["300308"]}' --pretty
```

### Check signals every day

MingCang splits the trading rhythm into four one-line workflows:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli premarket  --pretty   # pre-market: pre-sync checks and entry points
python3 -m backend.agent.cli intraday   --pretty   # intraday: fast read-only local-cache stock lookups
python3 -m backend.agent.cli postmarket --pretty   # post-market: full-market signals and review report
python3 -m backend.agent.cli weekend    --pretty   # weekend: long-term label refresh and weekly reflection
```

In the Pi terminal just say "run the pre-market scan" or "review after close." Signals include the day's suggestion, the ATR trailing-stop level, portfolio exposure, and data-quality alerts — MingCang never places the order, it just enforces discipline.

### Maintain a watchlist

Add a name (dry-run by default; add `--confirm` to commit):

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli action watchlist.add \
  --payload-json '{"symbol":"300308","name":"Zhongji Innolight","market":"CN"}' --pretty
```

Remove with `watchlist.remove`. Then scan the whole list via `project-context` or the post-market workflow. Or just tell the Pi terminal "add Zhongji Innolight to my watchlist" / "scan my watchlist."

### Run long-term research and keep tracking it

Record a sector or theme judgment (yours, a seasoned researcher's, or from a prosperity/financial framework) as a thesis with invalidation conditions; the system tracks it over time and reminds you to review on schedule:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli action long_term.run --payload-json '{"symbol":"300308"}' --pretty
```

It won't raise a buy score just because a thesis "sounds reasonable" — only after the outcome lands and the review passes does the judgment promote into trusted memory and feed the next round of research.

### Put memory to work

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli memory-snapshot --pretty
```

This shows layered memory, the audit log, and promotion status: which rules/lessons are trusted and which are still pending. Trusted memory is injected automatically as context the next time you research the same stock or theme.

## Agent integration

For Pi / Claude Code / Codex / Cursor, the minimal setup is:

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — local/remote boundaries
2. Load `STATUS.md` / `PROJECT.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` as the task requires
3. Mutating actions dry-run first and wait for confirmation

Core MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mingcang_project_context` | Positions, watchlist, memory summary, config overview |
| `mingcang_stock_context` | Single-stock signals, news, labels, copilot shadow |
| `mingcang_memory_snapshot` | Layered memory, audit log, promotion pipeline state |
| `mingcang_health` | Database, dependency, permission health check |

Legacy `stock_sage_*` tool names remain compatibility aliases.

## Configuration

<details>
<summary><b>Local and remote configuration</b></summary>

```env
AI_PROVIDER=local_cli
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////absolute/path/to/mingcang.db
MINGCANG_AGENT_MODE=local
```

Remote exposure is opt-in and read-only by default:

```env
MINGCANG_AGENT_MODE=remote
MINGCANG_AGENT_API_KEY=your_secret_key
MINGCANG_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_ENABLED=false
MINGCANG_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_ACTIONS=
```

Legacy `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_*` names are still read, but new deployments should use `MINGCANG_AGENT_*`. Keep `.env`, databases, personal trading records, and real keys out of Git.

## From StockSage to MingCang

The project was formerly **StockSage**; from 0.3.0 it's officially **MingCang / 明仓**. This is more than a rename:

- The whole research model was rebuilt into a case-based research-to-decision loop (research → signal → position → review → memory);
- Positioning shifted to "amplify human judgment, gated by forward evidence," adding thesis-import channels and a falsification scoreboard;
- A ready-to-use `mingcang` Pi terminal shell was added to lower the barrier to entry;
- A/HK/US read-only global data was expanded, with stronger data-quality and price-adjustment guards.

Legacy `stocksage`, `stock_sage_*`, and `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_*` paths remain available during the transition.

## Disclaimer

MingCang is a personal research tool, **not financial advice**. It doesn't place trades automatically. LLMs don't predict prices. Take-profit and stop-loss levels are generated from ATR formulas and risk constraints. All trading decisions and financial risk belong to the user.

---

## Where this is heading

In one line: **let AI amplify your judgment instead of guessing for you.** That splits into two tracks — how the research works, and making the tool easier to use.

**On research, a few principles:**

- **The judgment that actually makes money comes from people, not a model guessing.** The core is still you, plus researchers and proven frameworks you trust (prosperity, financial quality). MingCang's job is to watch those judgments, find holes, and warn you — not to "read tea leaves" from price action, a path we backtested and found has no edge.
- **AI does just two things: widen breadth and poke holes.** Breadth means surfacing news and leads one person can't cover — always as "unverified guesses." Poking holes means challenging your assumptions, tracking invalidation conditions, and alarming before a loss.
- **AI is welcome to get smarter, but it has to prove it with outcomes.** Any new model or capability may try, but it must prove itself on real results before it can influence your decisions; until then, the final call is always yours.
- **Only outcome-verified lessons are remembered.** Whether a judgment was right is settled only after the outcome lands and the review passes — never recorded as truth just because it "sounds reasonable."

**On the tool, what's coming next:**

- **Hong Kong and US markets.** A-shares are the main battleground today; HK/US are still read-only research context. Next we make them a full research → track → review pipeline like A-shares.
- **Polished frontend and backend.** Make the research console, signal views, and review records smoother to use, and the backend more stable, faster, and easier to maintain.
- **A genuinely usable piece of software.** The goal is a one-click, ready-to-use install that non-coders can run — not just a set of developer scripts.
