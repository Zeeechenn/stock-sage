# StockSage

> 🧠 A local-first personal A-share research workspace · Agent-ready · Auditable & traceable

StockSage organizes market data, news, fundamentals, QFII flows, positions, reviews and long-term memory in a single local SQLite store, then layers technical indicators, LLM news sentiment, long-term research, portfolio risk control and auditable memory on top — to give individual investors **a traceable research workspace**.

It supports research, reviews and risk alerts only — **it does not predict prices, place orders, or make the final investment decision for the user**.

## ✨ Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗂 **Local-first** | Market data, news, fundamentals, QFII, positions, reviews and long-term memory all live in a local SQLite — offline-capable and auditable. |
| 🤖 **Agent-ready** | Natively works with Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Cursor over both CLI and MCP. |
| 🔗 **Multi-source data** | efinance / Eastmoney / AkShare fallback by default; optional Tushare, yfinance, Tavily, Anspire enrichments. |
| 🧩 **Layered signals** | Technical indicators + LLM news sentiment + long-term analyst team + portfolio risk — each layer independently reviewable. |
| 🧠 **Auditable memory** | Project memory, layered decision memory and chat summaries each stored in their own bucket, every write audit-logged. |
| 🛡 **Risk-first** | Stop-loss / take-profit levels come from ATR formulas and portfolio constraints — LLMs never predict prices directly. |

> Current focus: **agent-ready usage**, data quality and research-review workflows. Not an automated trading system. The Web console is still evolving.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd stock-sage
make agent-setup        # Check Python, install deps, create .env, init the DB
make agent              # Enter the terminal pi shell and start asking in natural language
```

The minimum local setup only needs `AI_PROVIDER=local_cli` (uses the local Claude CLI) — **no cloud LLM key required**.

Verify things are healthy:

```bash
python3 -m backend.agent.cli health --pretty
```

Inside the pi shell you can ask directly:

```text
Check StockSage health.
Research 300308 with memory, news, positions and long-term labels.
Add 300394 to my watchlist.
```

> Research and health checks read local context directly. Mutating actions (watchlist, positions, memory, config) are dry-run first and require explicit confirmation before `backend.agent.cli action ... --confirm` executes them.

## 📋 Recommended Usage

| Option | When to use | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Hand the project to Codex / Claude Code** | Drop the repo at an agent and let it read the README, run health, configure `.env` itself | Any agent client |
| **A2. Terminal pi Agent** | You want a built-in research / review chat interface | `make agent-setup && make agent` |
| **B. Web console** (in development) | You want a graphical research dashboard | <http://localhost:5173> (API: <http://localhost:8000/docs>) |
| **C. Docker / compose** | You want a one-shot deployment of backend + frontend | `cp .env.example .env && make docker-up` |
| **D. Connect MCP tools** | You want StockSage as a tool surface for an outer agent | `make agent-mcp && make agent-mcp-config` |

<details>
<summary><b>Option A — hand the project to Codex / Claude Code</b></summary>

1. Send the GitHub homepage or repository URL to Codex / Claude Code.
2. Ask the agent to read `README.md` and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before running anything.
3. Ask the agent to run `python3 -m backend.agent.cli health --pretty` first to see database, memory, watchlist and position state.
4. Configure `.env` — for example `AI_PROVIDER=local_cli`, or set runtime keys such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
5. Let the agent install dependencies, initialize the database, start services or MCP, and approve privileged steps when prompted.
6. Use natural-language tasks for research, reviews, memory or project health checks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option A2 — terminal pi Agent</b></summary>

`make agent-setup` checks Python, installs StockSage agent dependencies, creates `.env`, initializes the database, and prompts for pi installation if needed. V1 defaults to reusing one Anthropic/OpenAI key for both the outer pi chat model and the StockSage internal LLM runtime. If you pick `AI_PROVIDER=local_cli`, the internal LLM workflows use the local Claude CLI instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option D — connect MCP tools</b></summary>

```bash
pip install -e ".[agent]"
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m backend.agent.mcp_server
# Or:
make agent-mcp
make agent-mcp-config
```

Connect this MCP server to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor or any MCP-capable client, and the outer agent can call StockSage's project context, memory snapshot, stock context and health tools.

## 🤖 Agent Usage Guide

StockSage already agent-ifies research, memory, reviews and health checks. The point is not "how to run it" — it's **what to delegate to it**.

### Tasks you can delegate

| User goal | Task to delegate | Typical output |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-stock research** | Read one stock's signals, news, positions, long-term labels, historical reviews and project memory. | Research summary, evidence trail, risks, follow-up questions. |
| **Topic research** | Investigate an industry, theme, value chain or group of stocks. | Theme conclusion, related symbols, source audit, questions to verify. |
| **Long-term research** | Run the long-term analyst team across sector thesis, financial quality, prosperity indicators and QFII flow. | Long-term label, score, key findings, hold / avoid rationale. |
| **Deep research** | Coordinate industry researcher, company researcher, risk reviewer, source auditor and report writer. | Markdown report, core conclusion, risk review, cited sources. |
| **Memory management** | Read or write long-term rules, risk preferences, research indexes, chat summaries and layered decision memory. | Memory summary, recall results, memory-write confirmations. |
| **Reviews and validation** | Analyze signal performance, attribution, win rate, drawdown, exit reasons and risk-rule execution. | Review summary, performance attribution, rule-calibration suggestions. |
| **Project health** | Check data coverage, scheduler, API, config, tests and docs. | Health report, anomalies, next maintenance steps. |

### Example prompts

```text
Read project memory, then research whether 300308 is still worth following.
Run an AI computing value-chain topic research report covering 300308 and 300394.
Run the long-term analyst team and refresh long-term labels for my watchlist.
Check current data coverage and scheduler health.
```

### Common MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `stock_sage_project_context` | Project runtime overview, config, positions, watchlist, memory summary. |
| `stock_sage_memory_snapshot` | `ai_memory`, layered memory, audit log, chat-summary status. |
| `stock_sage_stock_context` | Single-stock signals, news, positions, long-term labels and memory context. |
| `stock_sage_health` | Agent mode, database, dependency and permission health. |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Keys

StockSage reads all external keys from `.env` in the project root. **Never commit `.env`, real keys, the database or personal trading records to Git.** The minimum local setup needs only `AI_PROVIDER=local_cli`; enable news enrichment, push notifications and remote-agent exposure on demand.

| Variable | Purpose | Required? | How to obtain |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Powers StockSage internal LLM calls when `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic`. | Optional; required for the Anthropic runtime | Create a key in the Anthropic Console |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Used by `AI_PROVIDER=openai` for OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible endpoints. | Optional; required for the OpenAI runtime | Create a key on the provider's platform; for third-party endpoints also set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Supplements real-time search headlines when the DB has insufficient news in the last 24h; also used by `backfill_coverage --use-tavily` and long-term A-teacher evidence search. | Optional | Create an API key at [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/) |
| `ANSPIRE_API_KEY` | Fills strict event-style news gaps for the postmarket sentiment pipeline, filtering out market pages, profile pages and noisy sources. | Optional | Register at [Anspire AI Search](https://aisearch.anspire.cn), create a key on the API Keys page |
| `BARK_KEY` / `BARK_SERVER` | iOS Bark push for postmarket signals, stop-loss alerts and circuit-breaker warnings. | Optional; pushes silently skipped if unset | Copy the device key from the Bark app; default server is `https://api.day.app` — override `BARK_SERVER` if self-hosting |
| `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_API_KEY` | Authenticates remote agent / MCP / HTTP writes when `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_MODE=remote`. | Not needed locally; required when exposing the agent remotely | Generate a long random string; enable `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_ENABLED` and the action allowlist on demand |
| `TUSHARE_TOKEN` | Supplementary A-share daily-bar provider; once set, joins the CN fallback chain to pull unadjusted OHLCV via Tushare `daily`. | Optional | Get a token from [Tushare](https://tushare.pro/) |

**A typical local setup**:

```env
AI_PROVIDER=local_cli
TUSHARE_TOKEN=your_tushare_token_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
ANSPIRE_API_KEY=your_anspire_api_key_here
BARK_KEY=your_bark_device_key_here
BARK_SERVER=https://api.day.app
```

**For remote deployment / exposing MCP / HTTP to other machines, also add**:

```env
STOCKSAGE_AGENT_MODE=remote
STOCKSAGE_AGENT_API_KEY=replace_with_a_long_random_secret
STOCKSAGE_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_ENABLED=false
STOCKSAGE_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_ACTIONS=
```

### Recommended Signal Weights

Production currently defaults to the `new_framework` weighting. Based on existing backtests and validation results, the recommendation is to **temporarily exclude the quant layer from the composite score** and keep only technical and news-sentiment signals:

| Variable | Recommended | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `WEIGHT_QUANT` | `0.0` | Quant layers like Qlib / Kronos are still computed and logged but do not affect the composite score by default |
| `WEIGHT_TECHNICAL` | `0.6` | Weight of technical signals |
| `WEIGHT_SENTIMENT` | `0.4` | Weight of news-sentiment / event signals |
| `NEW_FRAMEWORK_ENTRY_THRESHOLD` | `25.0` | Composite score must exceed this to become a small-position trial candidate |

These are **current project recommendations, not hard-coded trading advice**. Adjust on the Web config page or in `.env`, and validate your own parameter mix with backtests and reviews.

## ⚠️ Cautions

### 🛡 Risk & Scope

- StockSage is a research and decision-support tool — **not investment advice, and it never places real orders**.
- LLMs do not directly predict prices; take-profit and stop-loss levels come from ATR formulas, portfolio constraints and risk rules.

### 🔐 Security & Permissions

- Local Codex / Claude Code sessions are trusted by default; remote agents are read-only by default.
- Remote writes require **all of** an API key, the remote-write switch, and an action allowlist.
- API keys are StockSage **runtime** credentials, not Codex / Claude Code chat credentials; they are consumed only when running the internal LLM, search, push or remote-agent pipelines.
- `.env`, databases, model files, personal trading records and real keys should never enter Git.

### 📊 Data & Quotas

- **Data sources and corresponding API keys**: A-share daily bars use the efinance / Eastmoney / AkShare fallback chain; setting `TUSHARE_TOKEN` appends Tushare `daily`, with yfinance as the final fallback. A-share fundamentals, QFII and base news go through AkShare / Eastmoney (no key required). Real-time news enrichment uses `TAVILY_API_KEY`; strict event-style news gap-filling uses `ANSPIRE_API_KEY`; iOS push uses `BARK_KEY`; remote agent auth uses `STOCKSAGE_AGENT_API_KEY`.
- **Free / trial quotas** (public information as of 2026-05-23):
  - **Tavily** Researcher free tier offers 1,000 credits / month; StockSage currently uses basic search (~1 credit per request); development keys default to 100 RPM, production keys to 1,000 RPM (paid plan or PAYGO required). See [Tavily Credits](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits) · [Rate Limits](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/rate-limits).
  - **Anspire** public docs mention checking each resource package's total quota and usage in the console but give no fixed free-quota figure; treat the [Anspire console](https://aisearch.anspire.cn) resource-package page as authoritative. See [usage guide](https://open.anspire.cn/document/docs/openPlatform/).
  - **Tushare** is used only as a supplementary A-share daily-bar source, calling the `daily` unadjusted endpoint; `daily` requires 120+ points, with the basic tier allowing 500 calls/minute at up to 6,000 rows per call. See [daily bars](https://www.tushare.pro/document/2?doc_id=27) · [permissions](https://www.tushare.pro/document/2?doc_id=108).
  - **Bark**'s `api.day.app` is the push entry point; the key comes from the app's test URL / device key. Public tutorials make no guarantee of free quota or SLA — self-host for high-frequency push. See [Bark tutorial](https://github.com/Finb/Bark/blob/master/docs/en-us/tutorial.md).

### 🧠 Usage Habits

- Before trading, research or reviews, read project context and project memory — **do not rely on the current chat window alone**.
- Long-term memory writes require explicit user intent; one-off questions and ordinary coding preferences should **not** enter trading-system memory.
- Daily postmarket batch signals keep multi-agent off by default to avoid linear runtime LLM token spend across 25+ stocks.
