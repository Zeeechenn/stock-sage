"""FastAPI routes aggregated from per-domain submodules.

Each submodule owns its own ``APIRouter`` and is mounted here in
registration order. ``backend.main`` imports the aggregated ``router`` and
mounts it under ``/api`` exactly as before, so the external URL contract is
unchanged.

A handful of endpoint functions are re-exported at module level for tests
that call them directly (e.g. ``from backend.api.routes import
dashboard_summary``).
